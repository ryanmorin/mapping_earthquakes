# mapping_earthquakes

## Overview

The project visualizes USGS earthquake data and overlays tectonic platesâ€™ location. The larger the earthquake, the larger the radius of the circle. The color of the circles coincide with the magnitude of the earthquake. The user has the ability select all earthquakes (magnitude of 0.01 and greater), the tectonic plates and/or earthquakes that exceed a magnitude of 4.5.
